Hi I’m Jason, and thanks for visiting my site! My hope for this space is to write about things that are interesting to me, and hopefully is also useful for other people. I can’t promise a steady stream of content, as I’m not a great writer, but I am going to try to post here from time to time.

## My road to becoming a tech professional

I was interested in working in tech as early as 5 years old. My dad had a tech role, and I wanted to be just like him. I asked for a computer for christmas at age 5, and actually received one! It was a Toshiba S1000x that had Windows 3.1 on it. For the first few years I just used it to play games, but around 10 I became more interested in how things worked.

From age 10 all the way through highschool I spent a lot of time trying out random things. I started out poking at Windows 2000 Server. After a while of poking I’d break something, so I’d either figure out how to fix it or would wipe the system and start over. I also dabbled with HTML and CSS a little in highschool.

On the professional side of things, I worked in the managed service provider space for about 10 years, primarily supporting small businesses. My duties varied greatly over the time I was there, and by the end I had done a little bit of almost everything. I spent a lot of time managing Windows Servers, Active Directory environments, Microsoft Exchange (and later Exchange Online), Ubiquiti networking, and Microsoft’s 365 stack.

Most recently I work at Microsoft, where I am a support engineer focused on Azure Networking.

Along the way, I got a Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology.

## Send me questions

I’m not always great at coming up with topics to write about. So if there is a question you have regarding how to do something with your personal technology, send it my way. If it’s something I know or can figure out, I could try to turn that into a new blog post.

And if something was helpful, feel free to [buy me a beer](https://coff.ee/jasontenpenny). It would make my day!
